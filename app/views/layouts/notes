Created jot form
    -edit jot
    

Issue: 
    When a user follows someone, it's also adding them to their follower list.
        - meaning they instantly follow eachother vs a one way follow
    

    - when a user clicks "followers" it goes to "following"

User is still adding itself when it follows 

when you hit follow, current_user is also added to the following list

Following Works

Where I am in project

    - When a user follows another user

    - Devise does not work
