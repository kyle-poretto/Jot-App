How It Works

How it works is simple. You jot, like a blog post but only for you to see. After your jot, you have the ability to share something you learned for the rest of the world. Those are called Jewels.

You can follow people that have insightful jewels. People can only post once so it’s not an “attention sucking” app. Instead it’s meant to be a place where you can go to learn insightful things and get inspiration from others.

It’s a fairly simple app. I used Devise for authentication. I hated Devise before doing this project, as I felt it was too much under the hood. However, once I started to really dive deep into Devise, I found the app to be a huge help. I will most likely use Devise moving forward as it’s a great framework to build an Auth system.
